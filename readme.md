This is an extension that makes Gnome's onscreen keyboard (the fully javascript one, not caribou) more useable.

* Arrow keys
* Esc + Tab + Ctrl + Alt keys
* F1 to F12 keys (see symbols layer)
* Resizes workspace

Known bugs/issues:
* Ctrl and Alt can be flaky after chaning the keyboard language
* No way to input shift+F_ shortcut
